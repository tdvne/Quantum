# Quantum - Undetectable LoL Script

The main objective of this script is to be completely hidden from Vanguard at the Kernel Level, meaning that feature enrichments will be limited due to the possibilities of detection.

Once this script is fully refined, it will be publicly released.

## Notable Features

- **[🤸] Evade**: Dodges enemy skillshots accurately at a humanized level.
- **[🔮] Prediction**: Predicts enemy next path and trajectory to hit skillshots & dodge skillshots.
- **[⚔️] Combo**: Attacks enemy with consecutive skillshot & attack combos.
- **[🛡️] Vanguard Bypass**: The most up to date Vanguard bypass is prioritized, including future patches.

## Notes

To reiterate, this script's main objective is to have the most up to date Vanguard Bypasses along with detection from future patches; however, this script does not protect you from **manual bans**, and you should still use this script conservatively.
